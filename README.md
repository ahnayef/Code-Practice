# Code Practice Repository

Welcome to your Code Practice repository. This repository is a place where you can store and organize all of your code practice. It is very convenient because you can easily access and move your code from one computer to another.

- **Install Git:** First things first, make sure you have Git installed on your computer. You can download it from [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Just follow the instructions that match your operating system.

- **Clone the Repository:** Now, open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where you want to keep your code practice repository. Once you're there, run this command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/ahnayef/Code-Practice.git
    ```
- **Start Practicing:** Great! Now that you have cloned the repository on your PC, it‚Äôs time to get coding. To organize your code, create directories and files. You can have different directories for different languages, frameworks or projects.

- **Commit and Push Changes:** To save your code, run the following commands in the terminal or in a command prompt:

    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -m "Commit message"
    git push
    ```
    üöÄ **You've got this!** Keep coding and striving for greatness! üë®‚Äçüíª
